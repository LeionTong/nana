Update to a more common access log-format

Update to a more common access log-format and change the awk print option to adapt to it .
So, next time I put in new variables that I mean to focus on into log-formate before variable $request_time ,I just need to fine-tune the awk print $(NF-<#>). Meanwhile I can throw what I doesn't care about into the line just following "$http_x_forwarded_for".



nagent.sh
fix "iPhone Version Details" mess display
	echo "[iPhone Version Details]"
	less $file | awk -F '"' '{if($6~"iPhone"){print $6}}' | awk '{name=$3;if($3=="iOS"){name=$4};types[name]++} END{for(name in types){printf("%s %s\n",types[name], name)}}' | sort -nr




nbalance.sh,npv.sh,ntr.sh
Change $#>10 to $(NF-<#>)
# is the number which adapted to the log-format
